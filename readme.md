Around 2007 I had dabbled enough in the opengl world to try and create my own first engine. I named it lunarlady and since it was my first engine, I naturally failed and created a overengineered mess and awas totally focued on creating a data driven menu system. While a mess, some parts of it are worth noting. The start of the sketchup based world editor among others.

As much as there are good ideas almost all of them have design flaws and need total or partial rewrites, and that's one of the reasons I abandonded it. If anyone wants to create a sketchup like tool for linux/mac designed for gamedev go ahead :)
